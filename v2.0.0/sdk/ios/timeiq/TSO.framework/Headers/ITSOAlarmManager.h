 @brief set an approximate Alarm: he alarm will not be delivered before this time, but may be deferred and delivered some time later.
 The OS will use this policy in order to "batch" alarms together across the entire system, minimizing the number of times the device needs to "wake up" and minimizing battery use. In general, alarms scheduled in the near future will not be deferred as long as alarms scheduled far in the future.
 @param listener - listener to get the OnAlarm
 @param action - action string so that the listener will know what to do...
 @param alarmId - unique id. can be used to cancel the alarm call. also 2 alarm calls with the same id the first will not be called.
 @param data - a data to be returned at onAlarm
 @param delay - delay in milliseconds

 @brief set a more exact alarm: The alarm will be delivered as nearly as possible to the requested trigger time. please note that it might have a few seconds delay as well. if the screen is ON - the alarm will be more accurate.
 Note: only alarms for which there is a strong demand for exact-time delivery (such as an alarm clock ringing at the requested time) should be scheduled as exact. Applications are strongly discouraged from using exact alarms unnecessarily as they reduce the OS's ability to minimize battery use.
